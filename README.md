## About this project

This example appointment app, was build to prove my skills as a Laravel coder.
The appointments helper source code can be found here  https://gist.github.com/Vinze/808ec88217729290adca4a06579a55b9
The skills I wanted to demonstrate, throught this example app, are:
-the ability to understand the task and build the business logic
-the usage of Laravel architecture
-the usage of naming conventions
-translations, through language files
-etc.

The app is not perfect, as I rushed in building it, while working on my ongoing projects :)
